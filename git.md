# Steps to starting the git

Step-1->    ENABLE GIT IN PROJECT BY             ( git init) 
            It enables the git to start tracking this folder, this makes a new .git folder it is hidden folder. It contains all the information of the versions or commits done up till now.

Step-2->    (git status)It tells about files which are tracked and are not tracked by the git.
             
Step-3->
             ``` Text
             There are 3 stages of any file 
             1st- >  Working directory  (These places in which the git does not track about the changes done the file, or it does not saves the current changes .)

             2nd- > Staging area    (git add <FileName>) (It starts tracking that perticular file , if something is in the staging area it will probably be a part of the next version / commit)

             3rd- > Repository (git commit) it will commit the files which are currently present at the staging area.
             
             ```
